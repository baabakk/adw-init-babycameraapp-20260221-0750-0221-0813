  "summary": "This initiative delivers a serverless baby monitor as a single HTML file that enables peer-to-peer video streaming between browser tabs. Parents can use any two devices (laptops, tablets) where one acts as the camera monitoring the baby and the other displays the live feed, with automatic cry detection triggering browser notifications even when the monitoring tab is backgrounded.",

    "problemStatement": "Parents need a simple, zero-infrastructure baby monitoring solution that works entirely in the browser without requiring server setup, app installation, or keeping the browser tab in focus, enabling real-time video streaming and cry detection notifications between devices.",

      "Enable peer-to-peer video streaming between browser instances without server infrastructure",
      "Detect baby crying and send browser notifications when the monitoring tab is open but not in focus",
      "Deliver the entire application as a single self-contained HTML file requiring no installation",
